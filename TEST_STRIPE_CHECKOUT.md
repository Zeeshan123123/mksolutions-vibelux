# 🧪 Testing Stripe Checkout with Credit Card Collection

## ✅ VERIFICATION COMPLETE - ALL SYSTEMS GO!

The verification script confirms:
- ✅ 14-day trial period configured
- ✅ Credit card collection enforced (always)
- ✅ Subscription cancels if no payment method
- ✅ Stripe keys configured
- ✅ 9 Stripe price IDs found
- ✅ UI shows trial information
- ✅ Payment collection endpoint ready

## 🔄 How The Flow Works

### 1. User Journey
```
Pricing Page → Select Plan → Stripe Checkout → Enter Card → Start Trial
     ↓              ↓              ↓                ↓            ↓
Shows Trial    "Start 14-Day"  Card Required   Not Charged   Full Access
   Banner         Trial                                      for 14 days
```

### 2. Code Flow
```javascript
// When user clicks "Start 14-Day Trial"
POST /api/stripe/checkout
  ↓
Creates Stripe Session with:
  - trial_period_days: 14
  - payment_method_collection: 'always'
  - trial_settings.end_behavior.missing_payment_method: 'cancel'
  ↓
Redirects to Stripe Checkout
  ↓
User MUST enter credit card
  ↓
Trial starts (no charge)
  ↓
After 14 days → Automatic charge
```

## 🎯 What Happens at Each Stage

### Day 0: Signup
- User selects plan
- Redirected to Stripe Checkout
- **MUST enter credit card** (enforced by `payment_method_collection: 'always'`)
- Card validated but NOT charged
- Trial starts immediately

### During Trial (Days 1-13)
- Full access to selected plan features
- Can cancel anytime
- No charges

### Day 14: Trial Ends
- **Automatic charge** to saved card
- OR if cancelled: Access ends
- OR if no valid card: Subscription auto-cancels

## 🔍 Key Configuration Points

### `/api/stripe/checkout/route.ts`
```typescript
subscription_data: {
  trial_period_days: 14,  // ✅ 14-day trial
  trial_settings: {
    end_behavior: {
      missing_payment_method: 'cancel'  // ✅ Cancels without card
    }
  }
},
payment_method_collection: 'always',  // ✅ FORCES card collection
```

### UI Updates
- Pricing page shows "14-Day Free Trial on All Paid Plans"
- Each plan card shows "14-day free trial" badge
- Buttons say "Start 14-Day Trial"
- Clear messaging: "Credit card required • Cancel anytime"

## 🧪 How to Test

### 1. Local Testing (Development Mode)
```bash
# Use Stripe test mode keys
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxxxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxxxx

# Test cards
Success: 4242 4242 4242 4242
Decline: 4000 0000 0000 0002
3D Secure: 4000 0025 0000 3155
```

### 2. Test Flow
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/pricing
2. Click "Start 14-Day Trial" on any paid plan
3. You'll be redirected to Stripe Checkout
4. Try to proceed WITHOUT entering a card → **Should be blocked**
5. Enter test card 4242 4242 4242 4242
6. Complete checkout
7. Check Stripe Dashboard → Subscription created with trial

### 3. Verify in Stripe Dashboard
- Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/subscriptions
- Find the new subscription
- Should show:
  - Status: "Trialing"
  - Trial ends: 14 days from now
  - Payment method: Card saved
  - Next invoice: $0 (until trial ends)

## ⚠️ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "No price ID available"
**Solution**: Set price IDs in environment variables
```env
STRIPE_GROWER_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID=price_xxxxx
STRIPE_PROFESSIONAL_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID=price_xxxxx
```

### Issue: Checkout doesn't require card
**Solution**: Verify `payment_method_collection: 'always'` is set

### Issue: Trial doesn't start
**Solution**: Check `trial_period_days: 14` is in `subscription_data`

### Issue: Subscription doesn't cancel without card
**Solution**: Ensure `trial_settings.end_behavior.missing_payment_method: 'cancel'`

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### WITH Credit Card:
- ✅ Trial starts
- ✅ Full access for 14 days
- ✅ Auto-charges after trial
- ✅ Continues as paid subscriber

### WITHOUT Credit Card:
- ❌ Cannot start trial
- ❌ Blocked at checkout
- ❌ Must enter card to proceed

### If Card Fails at Trial End:
