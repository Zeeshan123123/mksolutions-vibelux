## üî¥ Issues Found

### 1. **Missing Stripe Product IDs**
The following plans need Stripe products created:
- `design-solo` ($29/month) - No Stripe product
- `teams` ($99/month) - No Stripe product

### 2. **Mismatched Plan Names**
Current Stripe integration uses old names:
- "GROWER" ‚Üí Should be "Starter"
- "PROFESSIONAL" ‚Üí Correct ‚úÖ
- "BUSINESS" ‚Üí Should be "Enterprise"

### 3. **Feature Gating Issues**

**Current Implementation Problems:**
1. The `hasFeatureAccess()` function in `src/lib/stripe.ts` uses hardcoded feature lists that don't match the module system
2. The `SubscriptionContext` uses old tier names (GROWER, BUSINESS) instead of new ones
3. Module access checking is inconsistent between different parts of the app

---

## üìã Required Actions

### 1. **Create Missing Stripe Products**
```javascript
// Need to create in Stripe Dashboard:
- Product: "Design Solo" - $29/month
  Price ID: price_design_solo_monthly
  
- Product: "Teams" - $99/month
  Price ID: price_teams_monthly
```

### 2. **Update Environment Variables**
```env
# Add these to .env.local and Vercel:
STRIPE_SOLO_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID=price_xxx
STRIPE_TEAMS_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID=price_xxx
STRIPE_STARTER_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID=price_xxx (rename from GROWER)
STRIPE_ENTERPRISE_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID=price_xxx (rename from BUSINESS)
```

### 3. **Fix Feature Gating Code**
The subscription checking should use the module system from `unified-pricing.ts`:

```typescript
// Instead of hardcoded feature lists, use:
const userModules = SUBSCRIPTION_TIERS[userPlan].modules;
const hasAccess = userModules.includes(requiredModule);
```

### 4. **Update Stripe Webhook Handler**
Map the correct plan names when creating/updating subscriptions:
- `price_design_solo_monthly` ‚Üí `design-solo`
- `price_teams_monthly` ‚Üí `teams`
- `price_starter_monthly` ‚Üí `starter`
- `price_professional_monthly` ‚Üí `professional`
- `price_enterprise_monthly` ‚Üí `enterprise`

---

## ‚úÖ What's Working

1. **Pricing Display**: The `/pricing` page correctly shows all tiers
2. **Module System**: The module-based feature system is well-designed
3. **Credit System**: AI credits and usage limits are properly defined
4. **User Pricing**: Additional user pricing is correctly specified

---

## üö® Critical Path to Fix

1. **Create Stripe products** for Design Solo and Teams in Stripe Dashboard
2. **Update environment variables** with new price IDs
3. **Fix the subscription context** to use correct plan names
4. **Update webhook handler** to map price IDs to correct plan names
5. **Test end-to-end** subscription flow for each tier
