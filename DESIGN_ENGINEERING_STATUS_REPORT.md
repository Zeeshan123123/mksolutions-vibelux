  - Authentication flow
  
- **Missing**:
  - `forge-integration-service.ts` file not found
  - Need to create unified service wrapper
  
**Fix Required**:
```bash
# The service file needs to be created to unify Forge APIs
src/lib/forge/forge-integration-service.ts
```

### 2. Electrical Panel Features (85% Complete)
Some text labels missing in ElectricalDesignOutputPanel:
- Panel Schedule headers need adjustment
- Single Line Diagram labels incomplete

## üîß HOW IT ALL WORKS TOGETHER

### Design Workflow:
1. **Start at `/designer`** - Main design studio
2. **Choose view mode** - 2D, 3D, or split
3. **Place fixtures** - DLC database integration
4. **Generate electrical** - Automatic circuit creation
5. **Export drawings** - Professional CAD output

### File Structure:
```
/designer (main app)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AdvancedDesigner.tsx (orchestrator)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Canvas2D + Canvas3D (rendering)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SplitViewLayout (view management)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ElectricalDesignOutputPanel (schematics)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ProfessionalDrawingEngine (CAD export)
```

### Data Flow:
```
User Input ‚Üí Designer Context ‚Üí Canvas Updates ‚Üí 
Calculations ‚Üí Electrical System ‚Üí Drawing Generation ‚Üí 
CAD Export
```
