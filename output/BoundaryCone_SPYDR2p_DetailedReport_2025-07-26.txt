IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
-------------------
1. Fixtures should be installed on adjustable hangers
2. Maintain 6-12" distance from canopy for optimal uniformity
3. Use 0-10V dimming during vegetative stage (400-600 PPFD)
4. Implement sunrise/sunset ramping to reduce plant stress
5. Clean fixtures quarterly to maintain output
6. Monitor with quantum meter annually
