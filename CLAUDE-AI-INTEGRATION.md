# Claude AI Integration for VibeLux

## Overview

VibeLux now uses **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** (Anthropic) for all AI functionality instead of OpenAI. This provides better performance, more accurate responses, and enhanced reasoning capabilities for lighting design tasks.

## 🚀 What's Changed

### ✅ **Complete OpenAI → Claude Migration**
- Removed OpenAI SDK dependency
- Integrated Anthropic SDK (`@anthropic-ai/sdk`)
- Updated all AI components to use Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- Maintained all existing functionality

### ✅ **Updated Components**
- **AI Design Assistant** (`/src/components/AIDesignAssistant.tsx`)
- **AI Designer API** (`/src/app/api/ai-designer/route.ts`)
- **Fact-Based Design Advisor** (`/src/lib/ai/fact-based-design-advisor.ts`)
- **Claude Integration** (`/src/lib/ai/claude-integration.ts`)

### ✅ **Enhanced Features**
- Natural language design commands
- Scientific fact-based recommendations
- Advanced design analysis
- Contextual suggestions
- Usage tracking and limits

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Anthropic API Key
1. Go to [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Generate an API key
4. Copy the key (starts with `sk-ant-`)

### 2. Configure Environment
Add to your `.env.local` file:
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
```

### 3. Restart Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 AI Assistant Features

### **Natural Language Commands**
Users can interact with the AI assistant using natural language:

```
"Create a 40x60 room with 12 foot ceilings"
"Add 4x8 grid of fixtures for 800 PPFD"
"Add 3 rows of rolling benches"
"Optimize layout for better uniformity"
"Add lettuce plants in 4 rows"
"Place a 2 ton AC unit"
```

### **Advanced Design Analysis**
- PPFD calculations and optimization
- Fixture efficiency analysis
- Energy consumption insights
- Uniformity recommendations
- Scientific crop-specific guidance

### **Fact-Based Recommendations**
- Research-backed design suggestions
- Peer-reviewed scientific data
- Industry benchmark comparisons
- Credibility scoring for recommendations

## 🔍 API Endpoints

### **POST /api/ai-designer**

**Modes:**
- `parse` - Convert natural language to design actions
- `suggest` - Get contextual design suggestions
- `analyze` - Analyze current design performance
- `fact-check` - Get scientific recommendations

**Example Request:**
```json
{
  "mode": "parse",
  "message": "Create a 30x40 room with 600 PPFD",
  "currentState": {
    "room": null,
    "objects": [],
    "calculations": {}
  }
}
```

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "CREATE_ROOM",
      "params": {
        "width": 30,
        "length": 40,
        "height": 10
      }
    }
  ],
  "suggestions": ["Add fixtures for lighting", "Consider HVAC placement"]
}
```

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### **AI Design Assistant Component**
Located at `/src/components/AIDesignAssistant.tsx`:
- Chat interface for natural language interaction
- Real-time design action execution
- Contextual suggestions based on current state
- Usage tracking and limit enforcement

### **API Route Handler**
Located at `/src/app/api/ai-designer/route.ts`:
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet integration
- JSON parsing with error handling
- Authentication and usage limits
- Multiple operation modes

### **Claude Integration Class**
Located at `/src/lib/ai/claude-integration.ts`:
- Anthropic SDK wrapper
- Response parsing utilities
- Error handling and fallbacks
- Multiple AI assistant functions

## 📊 Usage Tracking

The system tracks AI usage by subscription tier:

### **Free Tier**
- 10,000 tokens/month (~10-15 queries)
- 5 requests/day
- Basic chat functionality

### **Starter Tier**
- 100,000 tokens/month (~100-150 queries)
- 50 requests/day
- Advanced recommendations

### **Professional Tier**
- 500,000 tokens/month (~500-750 queries)
- 200 requests/day
- All features including fact-based analysis

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

- API keys stored securely in environment variables
- User authentication required for all requests
- Request/response logging for debugging
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- No sensitive data sent to Anthropic

## 🧪 Testing

### **Manual Testing**
1. Navigate to `/design/advanced`
2. Click the AI assistant button (bottom-right)
3. Try natural language commands:
   - "Create a 20x30 room"
   - "Add fixtures for 500 PPFD"
   - "Analyze my design"

### **Expected Behavior**
- AI assistant opens with Claude branding
- Commands are processed and executed
- Design actions are applied to canvas
- Suggestions appear based on current state

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

**1. "Anthropic client not available"**
- Check `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env.local`
- Verify API key format starts with `sk-ant-`
- Restart development server

**2. "Usage limit reached"**
- Check user's subscription tier
- Verify usage tracking is working
- Consider upgrading subscription

**3. "JSON parsing error"**
- Claude response format issue
- Check error logs for details
- Retry request usually resolves

### **Debug Steps**
1. Check console for error messages
2. Verify API key is valid
3. Test with simple commands first
4. Check network requests in dev tools
