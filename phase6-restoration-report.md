  - Admin functionality
  - AI services
  - Analytics
  - Energy monitoring
  - Marketplace
  - Payments

  - Database utilities
  - API clients
  - Analytics modules
  - Email services
  - Grid/energy utilities
  - And more

### Additional Directories
- **Hooks**: 15 files
- **Contexts**: 3 files
- **Types**: 7 files

## Stub Implementations Created

To ensure the build works without all external dependencies, the following stub files were created:

1. `src/lib/db-stub.ts` - Database connection stubs
2. `src/lib/redis-stub.ts` - Redis connection stubs
3. `src/lib/influxdb-stub.ts` - InfluxDB connection stubs
4. `src/lib/pusher-stub.ts` - Pusher real-time connection stubs
5. `src/lib/services-stub.ts` - Email, SMS, and storage service stubs
6. `src/lib/missing-deps-stub.ts` - Additional stubs for Stripe, OpenAI, etc.

## Additional Files Restored
- `error.tsx` - Error boundary component
- `sitemap.ts` - Sitemap generation

## Next Steps

1. **Build Test**: Run `npm run build` to identify any remaining missing dependencies
2. **Type Checking**: Run `npm run type-check` to find type errors
3. **Replace Stubs**: Gradually replace stub implementations with real connections
4. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all required environment variables are set
5. **Testing**: Test critical paths and functionality

## Notes

- All files have been restored with their original directory structure maintained
- Stub implementations allow the application to build without external service dependencies
- The restoration prioritized completeness over immediate functionality
- Some API routes may need their service dependencies configured before they work properly

## Restoration Complete
Phase 6 has successfully restored the codebase to near 100% completion. The application should now have all pages, components, API routes, and supporting files from the original backup.
