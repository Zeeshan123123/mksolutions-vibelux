- [ ] Timeline: 6-12 months for SOC 2

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (Immediate - Week 1)
1. Write Information Security Policy
2. Document Incident Response Procedure
3. Enable MFA on all admin accounts
4. Confirm encryption settings

### Phase 2 (Week 2-3)
1. Implement RBAC in application
2. Set up monitoring/alerting
3. Create security training materials
4. Document all security controls

### Phase 3 (Month 2-3)
1. Background check process
2. Regular security reviews
3. Begin SOC 2 preparation
4. Security awareness training

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Enable MFA in Clerk
```typescript
// In Clerk Dashboard:
// Settings > Security > Multi-factor authentication > Required for admins
```

### 2. Role-Based Access
```typescript
// middleware.ts
import { authMiddleware } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export default authMiddleware({
  publicRoutes: ["/", "/sign-in", "/sign-up"],
  ignoredRoutes: ["/api/webhook"],
  afterAuth(auth, req) {
    // Check for utility data access
    if (req.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/api/utility')) {
      const hasAccess = auth.sessionClaims?.metadata?.role === 'admin' || 
                       auth.sessionClaims?.metadata?.role === 'manager';
      if (!hasAccess) {
        return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/unauthorized', req.url));
      }
    }
  }
});
```

### 3. Audit Logging
```typescript
// lib/audit.ts
export async function logDataAccess(
  userId: string,
  action: string,
  resource: string,
  details?: any
) {
  await sql`
    INSERT INTO audit_logs (
      user_id,
      action,
      resource,
      details,
      ip_address,
      timestamp
    ) VALUES (
      ${userId},
      ${action},
      ${resource},
      ${JSON.stringify(details)},
      ${req.ip},
      NOW()
    )
  `;
}
```

### 4. Data Encryption Verification
```sql
-- Verify Neon encryption
SELECT current_setting('server_version');
-- Should show encryption enabled

-- Create audit log table
CREATE TABLE audit_logs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  action TEXT NOT NULL,
  resource TEXT NOT NULL,
  details JSONB,
  ip_address TEXT,
  timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
