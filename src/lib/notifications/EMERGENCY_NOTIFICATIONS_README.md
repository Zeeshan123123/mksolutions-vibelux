## Overview

The emergency notification system has been fully implemented to handle critical service requests with immediate SMS and email alerts to qualified service providers.

## Features Implemented

### ‚úÖ Multi-Channel Notifications

- **Normal:** Email only, 24-48 hour response time

### ‚úÖ Intelligent Fallbacks
- Graceful degradation if services not configured
- Development mode logging
- Error handling without blocking workflows
- Non-critical failures don't stop other notifications

### Basic Usage

```typescript

const notification = {
  serviceRequestId: 'sr_123456',
  facilityName: 'Green Valley Cultivation',
  priority: 'emergency', // 'emergency' | 'urgent' | 'normal'
  category: 'HVAC',
  description: 'Climate control system failure - temperature rising rapidly',
  facilityAddress: '123 Main St, Denver, CO 80202',
  contactPerson: 'John Smith',
  contactPhone: '+1234567890',
  contactEmail: 'john@greenvalley.com'
};

const providers = [
  {
    id: 'provider_1',
    email: 'service@hvac-pros.com',
    companyName: 'HVAC Professionals',
    phone: '+9876543210'
  }
];

const result = await sendEmergencyNotifications(notification, providers);
// Returns: { success: boolean, errors: string[] }
```

### Integration in API Routes

Already integrated in `/src/app/api/service-requests/route.ts`:

```typescript
if (data.priority === 'emergency' || data.priority === 'urgent') {
  const { sendEmergencyNotifications } = await import('@/lib/notifications/emergency-notifications');
  
  await sendEmergencyNotifications(notification, emergencyProviders);
}
```

## Email Template

The system sends professional HTML emails with:

- **Color-coded headers** (red for emergency, orange for urgent)
- **Priority indicators** with expected response times
- **Complete facility information**
- **Contact details** for immediate follow-up
- **Action button** linking to dashboard
- **Service request ID** for tracking

### Example Email Subject:
```
üö® EMERGENCY Service Request - Green Valley Cultivation
```

---

## SMS Template

Concise messages designed for mobile:

```
üö® EMERGENCY: Green Valley Cultivation needs HVAC service. 
Contact: John Smith +1234567890. 
View: https://vibelux.ai/service-requests/sr_123456
```

---

## Internal Monitoring

### Slack Notifications
When `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` is configured, emergency requests trigger:
- Interactive Slack cards
- Direct links to view requests
- Notification to operations team

### Management Alerts
When `INTERNAL_ALERT_EMAIL` is configured, emergency requests send:
- Detailed management emails
- Complete request information
- Provider notification status

### Event Logging
All notifications are logged with:
- Service request ID
- Priority level
- Provider count
- Success/failure status
- Timestamps

---

## Priority Levels

| Priority | SMS | Email | Response Time | Use Case |
|----------|-----|-------|---------------|----------|
| **Emergency** | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | 1 hour | System failures, safety issues |
| **Urgent** | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | 4 hours | Equipment breakdowns, urgent repairs |
| **Normal** | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | 24-48 hours | Routine maintenance, inspections |

---

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
- Missing SendGrid key ‚Üí Logs warning, continues
- Missing Twilio config ‚Üí Skips SMS, sends email
- Email failure ‚Üí Logged, doesn't block SMS
- SMS failure ‚Üí Logged, doesn't block email
- Internal alert failure ‚Üí Logged, doesn't block customer notifications

### Development Mode
In development (`NODE_ENV=development`):
- No actual emails/SMS sent
- All notifications logged to console
- Full notification data visible for testing
- No API charges incurred

---

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Email Test:**
```bash
# Set environment variables
export SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_key
export NODE_ENV=production

# Create test service request via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/service-requests \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"priority": "emergency", ...}'
```

2. **SMS Test:**
```bash
# Set Twilio credentials
export TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_sid
export TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_token
export TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_number

# Same API call as above
```

### Development Testing
```bash
# Leave services unconfigured
NODE_ENV=development npm run dev

# Check console logs for notification attempts
```

---

## Monitoring & Metrics

### Success Tracking
- Email delivery rates
- SMS delivery status
- Provider response times
- Escalation patterns

### Logs to Monitor
```typescript
logger.info('Emergency email notification sent', { ... })
logger.info('Emergency SMS notification sent', { ... })
logger.warn('Emergency service request created', { ... })
logger.error('Failed to send notification', { ... })
```

### Dashboard Metrics (Future)
- Average response time by priority
- Provider notification success rate
- Emergency request volume
- Peak hour analysis

---

## Security Considerations

### Implemented
‚úÖ No sensitive data in SMS (only essential info)  
‚úÖ Secure links with service request IDs  
‚úÖ Provider information validation  
‚úÖ Rate limiting on notification endpoints  
‚úÖ Audit logging of all notifications  

### Best Practices
- Rotate Twilio auth tokens regularly
- Monitor SendGrid for suspicious activity
- Review notification logs weekly
- Test escalation procedures monthly

---

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending

**Check:**
1. `SENDGRID_API_KEY` is set correctly
2. SendGrid account is active and verified
3. From email is verified in SendGrid
4. Check SendGrid activity log
5. Review application logs for errors

### SMS Not Sending

**Check:**
1. `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` and `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` are correct
2. `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` is a valid Twilio number
3. Destination phone number is in E.164 format (+1234567890)
4. Twilio account has sufficient balance
5. Priority is 'emergency' or 'urgent' (not 'normal')

### Slack Webhooks Not Working

**Check:**
1. `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` is valid and active
2. Webhook has proper permissions
3. Test webhook with curl command
4. Priority is set to 'emergency'

## Cost Estimates

### SendGrid
- ~$0.001 per email
- Expected: ~100 emergency emails/month
- **Cost: ~$0.10/month**

### Twilio SMS
- ~$0.0075 per SMS (US)
- Expected: ~50 emergency SMS/month
- **Cost: ~$0.38/month**

**Total estimated cost: <$1/month** for typical emergency volume
