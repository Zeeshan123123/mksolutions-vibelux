# VibeLux Unimplemented Features Audit

**Generated**: 2025-07-21

This comprehensive audit identifies all unimplemented features, placeholders, stub implementations, and features that appear in navigation but are not functional.

## Executive Summary

The VibeLux codebase contains numerous unimplemented features across critical business functionality including:
- 19 stub components that display "disabled for performance" messages
- Multiple API endpoints returning mock/hardcoded data
- Critical payment processing TODOs that could affect revenue
- Navigation links to features that don't exist or show "Coming Soon"
- Hardcoded business logic that should be dynamic

## Critical Priority Issues

### 1. Payment & Subscription Management
**File**: `/src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`
- **Line 78**: `// TODO: Downgrade user to free plan` - Users who cancel won't be properly downgraded
- **Line 92**: `// TODO: Send email to customer about failed payment` - No payment failure notifications
- **Line 537**: `// TODO: Implement sendTrialEndingEmail` - Trial ending emails not sent
- **Impact**: Direct revenue impact, poor customer experience, potential subscription confusion

### 2. API Authentication & Usage Tracking
**File**: `/src/lib/auth/api-protection.ts`
- **Line 189**: `// TODO: Implement actual usage tracking` - API usage not tracked
- **Line 209**: `// TODO: Implement rate limiting logic` - No rate limiting implemented
- **Impact**: Cannot monitor API usage, security vulnerability, no usage-based billing

### 3. Environmental Monitoring
**File**: `/src/app/api/v1/environmental/data/route.ts`
- Returns completely mock environmental data (temperature, humidity, CO2, etc.)
- No integration with actual sensor systems
- **Impact**: Core monitoring feature is fake, misleading to users

## High Priority Issues

### 1. Stub Components (19 files)
These components show "disabled for performance optimization" instead of real functionality:
- `ServiceHealthDashboard.stub.tsx` - Service monitoring
- `EnergyOptimizationDashboard.stub.tsx` - Energy savings features
- `RevenueSharingDashboard.stub.tsx` - Revenue tracking
- `PilotProgramDashboard.stub.tsx` - Pilot program management
- `MobileFieldDashboard.stub.tsx` - Mobile features
- `SensorDataVisualization.stub.tsx` - Sensor data display
- `CFDVisualization.stub.tsx` - Computational fluid dynamics
- `VerticalFarmLayout3D.stub.tsx` - 3D farm visualization
- And 11 more...

### 2. Feature Flags System
**File**: `/src/lib/feature-flags.tsx`
- Lines 255-276: Database operations throw "Not implemented" errors
- Cannot create, update, or delete feature flags
- **Impact**: Cannot manage feature rollouts

### 3. Integration Services
Multiple integrations are not implemented:
- **ADP Payroll**: `/src/lib/integrations/payroll-integration.ts` - Lines 390, 395
- **USB Sensor Reading**: `/src/lib/sensors/licor-adapter.ts` - Line 271
- **PDF Generation**: `/src/lib/qr-code-generator.ts` - Line 271
- **CAD Conversions**: Multiple formats in `/src/lib/cad/`

## Medium Priority Issues

### 1. Navigation Links to Non-Existent Features
The main navigation includes links to:
- `/unified-dashboard` - Shows as "ðŸš€ Unified Dashboard"
- `/climate-intelligence` - Feature not implemented
- `/sensors/wireless` - Wireless sensor management
- These routes exist but show placeholder content or limited functionality

### 2. Hardcoded Business Logic
- Growth models use fixed values instead of dynamic calculations
- Environmental thresholds are hardcoded
- Pricing calculations use static percentages
- Historical yield fixed at 85% in multiple places

### 3. Mock Data in Production
Several services fall back to mock data:
- `generateMockSensorData()` - Returns random sensor values
- `generateMockWeatherForecast()` - Fake weather predictions
- Historical data generation uses random values

## Low Priority Issues

### 1. Missing Email Templates
- Trial ending notifications
- Payment failure alerts
- Subscription change confirmations

### 2. Incomplete Admin Tools
- User impersonation partially implemented
- Backup system has UI but limited functionality
- Analytics dashboard shows placeholder data

### 3. Developer Experience
- API documentation exists but many endpoints undocumented
- Console.log statements throughout production code
- Debug panels shipped to production

## Recommendations by Priority

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)
1. Implement payment webhook TODOs to prevent revenue loss
2. Remove or properly implement stub components
3. Add "Beta" or "Coming Soon" labels to incomplete features
4. Implement API rate limiting and usage tracking

### Short Term (Month 1)
1. Replace all mock data with real implementations or clear demo labels
2. Implement missing payment notifications
3. Complete sensor integration for environmental monitoring
4. Add proper error handling for unimplemented features

### Medium Term (Quarter 1)
1. Complete all integration services (payroll, sensors, etc.)
2. Implement feature flag system properly
3. Replace hardcoded business logic with configurable values
4. Complete 3D visualization features or remove from navigation

### Long Term
1. Implement all advertised features or update marketing
2. Complete mobile app functionality
3. Build out missing admin tools
4. Implement advanced analytics and ML features

## File Count Summary
- **TODO/FIXME Comments**: Found in 50+ files
- **Stub Components**: 19 files
- **Mock Data Returns**: 15+ API endpoints
- **"Not Implemented" Errors**: 12 locations
- **Hardcoded Values**: 30+ instances

## Business Impact
- **Revenue Risk**: Payment processing gaps could cause subscription issues
- **Trust Risk**: Users discovering mock data could damage credibility  
- **Security Risk**: No API rate limiting or usage tracking
- **Feature Parity**: Many advertised features don't work
- **User Experience**: Clicking navigation items leads to placeholders

This audit should be reviewed with product and engineering teams to prioritize implementation based on business impact and user needs.
