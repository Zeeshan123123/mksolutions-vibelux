## Conclusion

VibeLux has a solid foundation of CAD features but lacks many productivity tools that professional designers expect. The existing features focus on lighting-specific workflows, which is appropriate, but adding core CAD productivity features would significantly enhance designer efficiency and reduce the learning curve for CAD-experienced users.

The highest impact improvements would be:
- Precision coordinate input
- Advanced snapping options  
- Mirror/scale tools
- Basic dimensioning
- Construction guides

These additions would transform VibeLux from a specialized lighting tool into a professional-grade design platform.
