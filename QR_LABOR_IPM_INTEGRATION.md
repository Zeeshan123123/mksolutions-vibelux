# üéØ VibeLux Integrated QR + Labor + IPM System

## How It All Works Together

### üîÑ Complete Workflow

1. **Worker Clock-In via QR**
   - Worker scans zone QR code upon entering
   - System records: Worker ID, Zone, GPS location, Timestamp
   - Labor tracking begins automatically

2. **Real-Time Location Tracking**
   - GPS continuously tracks worker position
   - QR scans update zone location
   - All work is geo-tagged

3. **Pest Detection Flow**
   - Worker spots pest/disease
   - Takes photo with mobile app
   - AI instantly identifies pest type & severity
   - GPS coordinates are captured automatically

4. **Automated IPM Response**
   - System generates treatment protocol
   - Assigns to IPM team with exact location
   - Creates zone-specific action plan
   - Sends alerts if critical

5. **Data Integration**
   - Labor hours tracked by zone
   - Pest reports linked to specific plants/rows
   - Complete audit trail with GPS breadcrumbs
   - Heat maps show problem areas

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Generate Zone QR Codes
```javascript
// Each zone gets a unique QR code
const zoneQR = {
  type: 'zone',
  zoneId: 'A1',
  zoneName: 'Zone A1 - Vegetative',
  facility: 'Greenhouse-1'
};
```

### 2. Deploy Mobile App
- Workers download VibeLux Field app
- Login with worker credentials
- Grant GPS & camera permissions

### 3. Train Workers
- Scan QR to clock in/out
- Take photos of any pest/disease
- Complete tasks by scanning task QRs

### 4. Monitor Dashboard
- View real-time worker locations
- See pest reports as they come in
- Track labor costs by zone
- Analyze pest patterns over time

---

## üìä Analytics & Insights

### Labor Analytics
- Hours worked per zone
- Cost per square foot
- Task completion rates
- Worker efficiency scores

### IPM Analytics
