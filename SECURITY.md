# VibeLux Security Configuration Guide

## üö® CRITICAL SECURITY FIXES APPLIED

The following critical security vulnerabilities have been fixed:

### ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

1. **Hardcoded Database Credentials** - Removed from seed files
2. **Hardcoded API Keys** - OpenWeather API key now uses environment variable  
3. **Admin Setup Security** - Added production controls and logging
4. **localStorage Admin Bypass** - Removed dangerous authentication bypass
5. **Demo Mode Security** - Fixed always-enabled demo mode
6. **Weak Default Secrets** - All fallback secrets removed
7. **Test Credentials** - Hardcoded demo passwords removed
8. **Security Headers** - Enhanced CSP and security headers added

## üîß REQUIRED ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

Before deploying to production, set these environment variables:

### Critical (Application won't start without these):
```bash
DATABASE_URL="your-production-database-url"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="strong-random-secret-32-chars-min"
CLERK_SECRET_KEY="your-clerk-secret-key"
JWT_SECRET="strong-random-jwt-secret-32-chars-min"
ADMIN_SETUP_SECRET="strong-random-admin-secret"
```

### Recommended:
```bash
BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY="strong-encryption-key-32-bytes"
CSRF_SECRET="strong-csrf-secret"
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY="your-openweather-key"
```

### Production Controls:
```bash
NODE_ENV="production"
ALLOW_ADMIN_SETUP="false"  # Only set to true when needed
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE="false"  # Disable demo mode in production
```

## üîê SECRET GENERATION

Generate strong secrets using:

```bash
# For 32-byte secrets:
openssl rand -hex 32

# For 64-byte secrets:
openssl rand -hex 64

# For base64 secrets:
openssl rand -base64 32
```

## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY CHECKLIST

### Before Production Deployment:

- [ ] All environment variables set with strong secrets
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in codebase
- [ ] Admin setup disabled (`ALLOW_ADMIN_SETUP=false`)
- [ ] Demo mode disabled (`NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=false`)
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] HTTPS enabled with valid SSL certificate
- [ ] Database backups configured with encryption
- [ ] Monitoring and logging enabled
- [ ] CSP policy tested and working
- [ ] Authentication system tested
- [ ] Admin access properly controlled

### Security Monitoring:

- [ ] Set up alerts for failed authentication attempts
- [ ] Monitor admin endpoint access
- [ ] Log all privileged operations
- [ ] Regular security scans
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability monitoring

## üö® IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

1. **API Key Security:**
   - The old hardcoded OpenWeather API key has been replaced with proper environment variable configuration
   - Current VibeLux OpenWeather key: `d6343b4e505808c536058f99280ad0e5`

2. **Database Security:**
   - Change database credentials if the exposed connection string was used
   - Ensure database is properly firewalled

3. **Admin Access:**
   - Generate new admin setup secret
   - Review and audit all admin accounts

## üìã DEPLOYMENT STEPS

1. **Generate all required secrets**
2. **Set environment variables in production**
3. **Test security validation locally first**
4. **Deploy to staging environment**
5. **Run security validation tests**
6. **Deploy to production**
7. **Verify security headers are active**
8. **Test authentication flows**

## üîç SECURITY VALIDATION

The application now includes automatic security validation that:

- Checks for required environment variables
- Validates secret strength
- Warns about insecure configurations
- Prevents startup with critical security issues in production

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ONGOING SECURITY MAINTENANCE

1. **Regular Secret Rotation** - Rotate secrets every 90 days
2. **Dependency Updates** - Keep all dependencies updated
3. **Security Audits** - Regular security reviews
4. **Access Reviews** - Periodic admin access audits
5. **Monitoring** - Active security monitoring and alerting

## üìû INCIDENT RESPONSE

If security issues are discovered:

1. **Immediate:** Disable affected systems
2. **Investigate:** Determine scope of compromise  
3. **Remediate:** Fix vulnerabilities
4. **Rotate:** Change all potentially compromised secrets
5. **Monitor:** Enhanced monitoring post-incident
