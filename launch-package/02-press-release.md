## VibeLux Launches Revolutionary Cultivation Intelligence Platform, Unifying Design, Operations, and Compliance for Professional Growers

### First-of-its-kind platform integrates 475+ tools including AI prediction models, GMP compliance automation, and IoT device management in single comprehensive solution

**DENVER, CO – [DATE]** – VibeLux, the cultivation intelligence platform, today announced the public launch of its comprehensive facility management solution that transforms how professional growers design, build, and operate cultivation facilities. The platform represents the first integrated approach to cultivation management, combining advanced photometric design tools, predictive analytics, compliance automation, and operational management in a single system.

**Breaking Down Industry Silos**

Traditional cultivation operations require multiple disconnected software solutions for lighting design, environmental monitoring, compliance tracking, and business management. VibeLux eliminates this fragmentation by providing an integrated platform that spans the entire facility lifecycle – from initial design concepts to daily harvest operations.

"The cultivation industry has been forced to cobble together dozens of different tools and spreadsheets to manage their operations," said Blake Lange, Founder and CEO of VibeLux. "We've built the first platform that actually understands the complete cultivation workflow and provides professional-grade tools for every aspect of facility management."

**Industry-Leading Technical Capabilities**

VibeLux launches with an unprecedented feature set that includes:

- **Professional Photometric Tools**: Real IES file integration with 2,000+ DLC-certified horticultural fixtures and advanced beam pattern analysis

- **GMP Compliance Automation**: 21 CFR Part 11 validation with automated document processing and audit trail generation
- **Multi-Protocol IoT Integration**: Native support for MQTT, LoRaWAN, Modbus, HTTP, and WebSocket device protocols
- **OCR Document Processing**: Automated compliance document analysis with support for multiple OCR providers
- **Financial Integration**: Direct QuickBooks and Xero synchronization for seamless business operations

**Research-Backed Cultivation Protocols**

The platform incorporates advanced Dutch greenhouse research protocols, including specialized tools for tomato cultivation with VeGe balance analysis, P-Band climate control, and light-based irrigation optimization. These research-proven methodologies are now accessible to growers of all scales.

**Comprehensive Compliance Management**

VibeLux addresses the complex regulatory landscape facing cultivation facilities with automated compliance workflows. The platform includes METRC integration for cannabis operations, GMP protocol automation for pharmaceutical cultivation, and comprehensive audit trail generation that simplifies regulatory inspections.

**Enterprise-Grade Analytics and Reporting**

The platform provides institutional-quality financial modeling, sustainability impact analysis, and multi-facility performance benchmarking. Professional reports can be generated for stakeholders, with custom branding and multiple export formats including PDF, Excel, and CAD integration.
