❌ **The Problem:**
Professional growers use 10+ disconnected tools:
• Lighting design software
• Environmental monitoring apps  
• Compliance spreadsheets
• Financial management tools
• IoT device platforms
• Manual calculations

This fragmentation costs time, money, and optimization opportunities.

📊 6 ML models for optimization
🔧 475+ professional tools
