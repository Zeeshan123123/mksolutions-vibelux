"Hi, I'm Blake Lange, and after two years of development, I'm incredibly excited to announce the public launch of VibeLux – the world's first complete cultivation intelligence platform."

**[8-20 seconds]**
"VibeLux isn't just another grow light calculator. We've built something revolutionary: a single platform that takes you from facility concept to harvest optimization. Whether you're designing a new greenhouse, managing compliance, or optimizing yields – it's all here."

**[20-35 seconds]**
"Our platform includes professional photometric tools with real IES data, AI-powered design assistants, 6 machine learning prediction models, GMP compliance automation, IoT device integration, and even QuickBooks sync. We've integrated everything professional growers actually need."

**[35-50 seconds]**
"We're launching with three tiers starting at $49 per month, and honestly, we've packed in features that would normally cost thousands separately. Over 475 tools, research-backed protocols, and enterprise-grade analytics – all in one place."

**[50-60 seconds]**
"VibeLux is live today at vibelux.com. Join thousands of growers already optimizing their operations. This is the future of cultivation intelligence, and it starts now."
