## Main Post

ðŸš€ **Today marks a milestone I've been working toward for two years.**

I'm thrilled to announce the public launch of **VibeLux** â€“ the world's first complete cultivation intelligence platform that unifies facility design, operations, and compliance in one comprehensive solution.

**Why VibeLux matters:**

The cultivation industry has been forced to use 10+ disconnected tools for basic operations. Lighting design in one app, environmental monitoring in another, compliance tracking in spreadsheets, financial management somewhere else entirely.

We've built something different. VibeLux is the first platform that actually understands the complete cultivation workflow.

**What we've launched:**
âœ… 475+ integrated tools and calculators  
âœ… AI-powered facility design with conversational interface  
âœ… 6 machine learning models for yield and energy optimization  
âœ… GMP compliance automation with 21 CFR Part 11 validation  
âœ… Multi-protocol IoT integration (MQTT, LoRaWAN, Modbus)  
âœ… OCR document processing for compliance automation  
âœ… Direct QuickBooks/Xero integration  
âœ… Professional photometric tools with 2,000+ DLC fixtures  

**The result?** Early customers report 15-25% energy savings and 30% reduction in compliance prep time.

This isn't just another SaaS tool. It's a fundamental shift toward intelligent cultivation management.

VibeLux is live today at vibelux.com. Three tiers starting at $49/month.

To everyone who's supported this journey â€“ advisors, early users, and the amazing team who made this possible â€“ thank you. This is just the beginning.

"Getting great questions about ROI. Our customers typically see payback within 4-6 months through energy optimization alone. The compliance time savings are often worth the subscription by themselves."

"For anyone interested in a demo, we're doing live walkthroughs all week. The AI design assistant is particularly impressive - you can literally describe your facility in plain English and watch it create the optimal layout."
