- Weather data (needs NOAA key)

## üè≠ Active Facilities

**Currently: 0 active production facilities**

The system is ready for production deployment but needs:
1. Real customers to onboard
2. Hardware installations
3. API credentials from utilities
4. Lab partnerships

## üìà Reality Check

### **What VibeLux Actually Is:**
- **Powerful design & calculation platform** ‚úÖ
- **Comprehensive business management suite** ‚úÖ
- **Ready for energy savings program** ‚úÖ
- **Scalable SaaS architecture** ‚úÖ

### **What It Needs to Be Fully Operational:**
1. **Real Customers** - Need actual facilities to onboard
2. **Hardware Partners** - Sensor/controller manufacturers
3. **Utility Integrations** - API access agreements
4. **Content & Data** - Recipes, benchmarks, ML training data

### **Feature Count Reality:**
- **Claimed:** "500+ features"
- **Actually Implemented:** ~300 features
- **Production Ready:** ~200 features
- **Need External Dependencies:** ~100 features

## üöÄ Next Steps for Production

### **Immediate Priorities:**
1. Run database migrations: `npm run db:migrate:deploy`
2. Set up production environment variables
3. Deploy to Vercel/AWS
4. Configure monitoring (Sentry, Datadog)
5. Set up backup systems

### **Customer Onboarding Needs:**
1. Sales materials with accurate feature list
2. Hardware partnership agreements
3. Utility API access requests
4. Support documentation
5. Training materials

## üí° Recommendations

### **Be Transparent About:**
- Current simulation vs. future real data
- Hardware requirements for full features
- Integration timelines
- Pilot program vs. full production

### **Focus Marketing On:**
- Energy savings program (fully ready)
- Design tools (working great)
- Calculation suite (comprehensive)
- Business management (functional)

### **Development Priorities:**
1. Mobile app for Visual Ops
2. Hardware partner integrations
3. Content creation (recipes, SOPs)
4. ML model training with real data
5. Customer success tools

**System Status:** PRODUCTION CAPABLE ‚úÖ
**Customer Ready:** WITH DISCLAIMERS ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Revenue Ready:** YES (Energy Savings) ‚úÖ
**Scale Ready:** YES (Architecture) ‚úÖ

The platform is impressive and production-capable, but needs to be marketed honestly about what's real vs. what's planned. Focus on the working features (energy savings, design tools, calculations) while building toward the full vision.
