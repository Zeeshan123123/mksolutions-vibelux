**Technical Specifications:**
- Complete fixture specifications (PPF, efficacy, beam angles, dimensions)
- Real DLC-qualified products from 2,000+ fixtures
- Accurate PPFD calculations and uniformity analysis
- Professional BOM with part numbers and suppliers
- Energy consumption calculations and operational metrics

**Professional Deliverables:**
- 3D BIM models (Autodesk Forge format)
- CAD files (DWG, IFC, Revit)
- Installation documentation and procedures
- Commissioning plans and testing protocols
- Maintenance schedules and replacement guides

### ‚ùå **What VibeLux Does NOT Provide:**

**Pricing Information:**
- **No fixture pricing** - DLC database contains no cost data
- **No installation cost estimates** - Highly location and contractor dependent
- **No procurement pricing** - Prices vary by volume, timing, and relationships
- **No ROI calculations with actual costs** - Would require real pricing data

## Why We Don't Include Pricing

### **1. DLC Database Limitations**
The DesignLights Consortium database contains technical specifications only:
- Photosynthetic Photon Flux (PPF)
- Efficacy (Œºmol/J)
- Power consumption (watts)
- Physical dimensions
- **No pricing information whatsoever**

### **2. Market Reality**
Fixture pricing varies dramatically based on:
- **Volume discounts** (1 fixture vs. 100 fixtures)
- **Project timing** (availability and demand cycles)
- **Distributor relationships** (different markup structures)
- **Geographic location** (shipping, taxes, local competition)
- **Installation complexity** (labor costs vary 300%+ by region)

### **3. Professional Ethics**
Providing inaccurate pricing estimates would be misleading and could lead to:
- Poor project budgeting
- Vendor relationship issues
- Procurement decision problems
- Client trust concerns

## What We Recommend Instead
